# MSF-1: Financial Stochastic Modeling Assignment

This repository contains the assignment work for the **Financial Stochastic Modelisation 1** course. The project explores various pricing techniques for financial derivatives using stochastic modeling approaches. Each notebook delves into a specific question, covering different techniques, models, and numerical methods used in modern financial engineering.

## Global Idea

The goal of this project is to implement and analyze various techniques for pricing financial derivatives, emphasizing stochastic processes. The repository serves as a comprehensive study of financial models, showcasing both theoretical underpinnings and numerical implementations.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used throughout the notebooks to implement the models and perform simulations:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **Pandas**: To handle data structures and manage datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results of simulations and pricing.
- **SciPy**: To solve equations and handle advanced mathematical computations.
- **SymPy**: For symbolic mathematics and formula derivations.
- **Statsmodels**: To analyze statistical properties of the models.
- **Pytorch**: For deep learning models and neural networks.

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy sympy statsmodels torch
```

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the notebooks.
